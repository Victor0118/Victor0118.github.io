- I am a research engineer in [Boreaslis.ai](https://www.borealisai.com/en/), where I am dedicated to deploying AI algorithms into industrial applications, especially financial services. Previously, I was a machine learning engineer at [RSVP.ai](https://rsvp.ai/en/#/index), where I sought natural language understanding (NLU) solutions for the services with business partners.
- My research interests include 1). information retrieval, 2). NLP applications: question answering, semantic parsing, 3) data driven machine learning: zero/few-shot learning, transfer learning, meta-learning. 
- I got my Master of Mathematics (Computer Science) degree at the University of Waterloo, under the supervision of [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/) at the Data System group.
- I got my B.S. degree in computer science and technology at Zhejiang University. I also worked as a research assistant with Professor [Lu Wei](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei) in the winter of 2017 (actually there is no winter in Singapore).
