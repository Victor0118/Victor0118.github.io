- I am a Machine Learning Engineer at RSVP.ai.
- My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning, specifically question answering, reading comprehession and intelligent chatbot. 
- I got my Master of Mathematics (Computer Science) degree at the University of Waterloo since 2017, under the supervision of [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/) at the Data System group of the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Sciencei.
- I got my B.S. degree in computer science and technology at Zhejiang University, China. I also worked as a research assistant with Professor [Lu Wei](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei) in the winter of 2017 (actually there is no winter in Singapore) and Professor [Ajay Kumar](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csajaykr/) in the summer of 2016.
